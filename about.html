            <h1>Short Summary:</h1>
            <p>We started small, selling mini scooters and a mix of random motorcycles just to test the waters. Over time, with more experience and a clearer vision, we improved our selection, learned the market, and slowly got introduced to the bigger world of motorcycle sales. What began as a small idea has grown into a serious passion-driven business that's still expanding every day.</p>
            <h2>When did we open?</h2>
            <p>We officially launched online in early 2025. Since then, we've been working nonstop to grow our inventory, improve our services, and build a solid reputation. We're still on the hunt for the perfect location to open our first physical store — but until then, we're fully committed to offering great bikes and reliable service online.</p>
            <h2>Why choose us?</h2>
            <p>It's simple: honesty. If you can genuinely find better prices somewhere else, then I'll be happy you got a good deal — even if it's not from us. But what we offer is fair pricing, straightforward communication, and a dedication to helping customers get the motorcycle that fits their needs, not just the one that's most expensive. We care about building trust, not squeezing every dollar.</p>
